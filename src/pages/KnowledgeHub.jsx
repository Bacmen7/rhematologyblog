                Rheumatology is a branch of medicine that focuses on conditions affecting your joints, muscles, and bones. These include everyday problems like joint, bone or muscle pain and stiffness. It also comprises conditions where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.

                A doctor who specialises in this field is called a rheumatologist. They are trained to diagnose, treat, and manage conditions such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Gout, Lupus, Osteoporosis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis, among others.
